This is a repository you can use to start your HTML/CSS/JavaScript project.

I have included: index.html, styles.css, main.js, and bs.bat - the batch file that will start browser-sync automatically

There is also a .gitignore which will cause GitHub to ignore a bunch of files that shouldn't be stored (like temp files, log files, node libraries, etc)

Make sure you edit index.html first and add your name in the author meta field. Then commit and push to make sure it's working for you.
